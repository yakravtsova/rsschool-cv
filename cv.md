### About me:

I like to find solutions to complex problems and learn new things. I like web development because you can write code and immediately see the result of its execution in the browser. And you immerse in the fascinating process of debugging code and finding a solution if the result is not yet visible.

I graduated from a web development course at Yandex Practicum. Apparently my skill level is not enough for getting a job. That's why I keep learning and developing my skills.

### My priorities:

+ :woman_juggling: I study new technologies
+ :computer: I try to write clean code
+ :weight_lifting_woman: I practice a lot
